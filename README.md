# Financial Markets Simulation

This is a Python package which recreates a financial market via a Scale-Free network instantiated using the Barabasi-Albert algorithm (via the [networkx package](https://github.com/networkx/networkx)). The packages focuses on the analysis of the self-organized criticality in a simulated market compliant with the financial stylized facts and the Efficient Market Hypothesis. In particular, a price time series is created and wide price movements (i.e. avalanches) are studied in their duration, size and laminar time. The avalanches are extracted using the Wavelet Method as described in *"Self-organized criticality and stock market dynamics: an empirical study"* (2005, Bartolozzi et al.) and plotted in log-log scale, fitting a curve to understand the behavior of the distribution.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3.6 or higher, and the following packages:

* `networkx`
* `matplotlib`
* `scipy`
* `pywt`
* `powerlaw`

### Installing

You can clone the repository with the code, move into the `src` folder and run

`python main.py read_data save_fig num_simulations num_processes`

where the parameters indicate:

- `read_data`: Controls whether to read existing data

Type: Boolean (0 or 1)
Required: Yes
Example:

`1`: Read existing data
`0`: Do not read existing data

- `save_fig`: Determines whether to save generated figures

Type: Boolean (0 or 1)
Required: Yes
Example:

`1`: Save figures
`0`: Do not save figures

- `num_simulations`: Specifies the total number of simulation runs

Type: Integer
Required: Yes
Example: `100` runs 100 simulations

- `num_processes`: Sets the number of parallel processes to use

Type: Integer
Required: Yes
Example: `4` uses 4 parallel processes for simulations
