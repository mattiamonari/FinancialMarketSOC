# Financial Markets Simulation

This is a Python package which recreates a financial market via a Scale-Free instantiated using the Barabasi-Albert algorithm (via the [networkx package](https://github.com/networkx/networkx)). The packages focuses on the analysis of the self-organized criticality in a market following the Efficient Market Hypotesis and in particular in the avalanches' duration, size and laminar time. The avalanches are extracted using the Wavelet Method as described in *"Self-organized criticality and stock market dynamics: an empirical study"* (2005, Bartolozzi et al.) and plotted fitting a power law to both the sizes and the laminar times and .
