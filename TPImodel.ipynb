    "### Deriving our hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) AVALANCHE DETECTION AND ANALYSIS HYPOTHESIS\n",
    "\n",
    "- this model generates price fluctuations driven by trade imbalances and the specific networked interactions on a scale-free network;\n",
    "- wavelet transform analysis (found in wavelet.py) is used to detect abrubt changes in the price series by decomposing the signal into trend and residual components;\n",
    "- the residual component captures sharp deviations, which correlate with high market activity, indicating avalanches;\n",
    "- the avalanches are part of the market's macro-behavior, and are expected to follow a power-law  distribution, consistent with self-organized criticality \n",
    "- network-driven trading creates abrupt price shifts when influential nodes are active, and influence propagation causes coordinated position shifts leading to large cascades reflected in price movement\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_1$ : Avalanches in price movement can be detected using wavelet transform analysis, where significant deviations in the residual signal correspond to periods of high market activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) FINANCIAL MARKETS AND SOC HYPOTHESIS\n",
    "\n",
    "- in financial markets, studies have analyzed avalanches and found they often follow power-law distributions in size and duration;\n",
    "- however in our analysis the inter-times also follow a power law (as in Bartolozzi et al. 2005), suggesting that instead of a Possion-like (memoryless) process, we observe temporal correlations, and what is described as a near-SOC or quasi-SOC state \n",
    "\n",
    "$H_2$ : The size and duration of market price avalanches exhibit scale-invariant behavior, following power-law distributions as observed in SOC systems. However, the market price avalanches of the simulated system do not emerge as true SOC, as indicated by the power-law distribution of avalanche inter-times\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) TPI NETWORK AND STYLIZED FACTS HYPOTHESIS\n",
    "\n",
    "- large price jumps (large returns) occur more frequently than in a normal distribution, which is a well known empirical fact in financial markets\n",
    "- VOLATILITY CLUSTERING: the model exhibits periods of high and low volatility, where large price changes are followed by further price changes\n",
    "- AUTOCORRELATION IN RETURS & SQUARED RETURNS: while raw returns show low autocorrelation, squared returns wxhibit stronger persistence as a key featrue of real financial markets\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_3$ : A simple TPI network with heterogeneous traders (hedge funds, following traders, and random traders) is sufficient to reproduce key stylized facts of financial markets, including fat-tailed return distributions and volatility clustering, as well as autocorrelation in the returns and squared returns."
